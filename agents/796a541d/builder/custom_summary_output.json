  "output": "## Summary\n\nSuccessfully fixed the EADDRINUSE error for port 3010 and configured the Next.js application to use port 3000 consistently.\n\n### Work Completed:\n\n1. **Identified and killed orphaned process on port 3010**\n   - Found Next.js server (PID 36556) running on port 3010\n   - Terminated the process to free the port\n\n2. **Configured Next.js to explicitly use port 3000**\n   - Updated `package.json` dev script to use `-p 3000` flag\n   - Ensures consistent port usage across development environments\n\n3. **Created environment configuration documentation**\n   - Added `.env.example` file documenting the PORT configuration option\n   - Provides reference for future environment-based port configuration\n\n4. **Updated README.md documentation**\n   - Added note about port 3000 configuration in the Installation section\n   - Documented troubleshooting steps for EADDRINUSE errors\n   - Included commands to kill processes and change ports if needed\n\n5. **Validated the fix**\n   - Started development server successfully on port 3000\n   - Verified application accessibility with HTTP 200 response\n   - Confirmed no EADDRINUSE errors occurred\n\n### Files Changed:\n\n```\nAM package.json          (1 line changed: explicit port configuration)\n?? .env.example          (3 lines: new file)\n?? README.md             (4 lines added: port documentation)\n```\n\n**Total: 3 files modified/created, ~8 lines changed**\n\nThe application now runs reliably on port 3000 without conflicts."
