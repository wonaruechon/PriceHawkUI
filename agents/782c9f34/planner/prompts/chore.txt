/chore 782c9f34 Enhance Manual Comparison page UX/UI for better usability: 1) Simplify the wizard to a 
  cleaner single-column flow with collapsible completed steps instead of 2-column grid layout. 2) Replace plain text retailer
   buttons with styled cards showing retailer logos/icons, making selection more visual and scannable. 3) Improve the 
  StageIndicator component to show clearer progress with checkmarks, active state highlighting, and step descriptions. 4) 
  Redesign UserValidationPanel to clearly explain match status - replace confusing '1 URL Not Match 0%' with friendly icons, 
  color-coded status (green=match, red=no match, yellow=partial), and clear action guidance. 5) Add a comparison summary card
   before the Compare button showing Thai Watsadu product info alongside selected competitor retailers. 6) Improve visual 
  hierarchy with distinct card styling for source product (Thai Watsadu) vs competitor inputs using different border colors 
  or background shades. 7) Make 'Add another URL' button more prominent with better styling. 8) Add helpful tooltips or 
  inline hints explaining what each step requires. Keep existing 4-stage flow logic (input → selecting → competitor_urls → 
  validation) but improve the visual presentation and user guidance throughout the journey.
