/chore 4ca412fc Fix responsive design issues in Manual Comparison page: 1) StageIndicator.tsx has
  duplicate text on mobile - the mobile label at lines 69-77 always renders both hidden and visible states incorrectly, fix
  the conditional rendering so only active stage shows label on mobile. 2) Sidebar.tsx needs responsive classes - add 'hidden
   md:flex' to hide sidebar on mobile/tablet and ensure MainLayout handles the responsive layout properly. Reference the
  /products page responsive behavior for consistency.
