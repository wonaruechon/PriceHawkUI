    "Fix responsive design issues in Manual Comparison page: 1) StageIndicator.tsx has\n  duplicate text on mobile - the mobile label at lines 69-77 always renders both hidden and visible states incorrectly, fix\n  the conditional rendering so only active stage shows label on mobile. 2) Sidebar.tsx needs responsive classes - add 'hidden\n   md:flex' to hide sidebar on mobile/tablet and ensure MainLayout handles the responsive layout properly. Reference the\n  /products page responsive behavior for consistency."

Fix StageIndicator mobile label conditional rendering\n2. Add responsive classes to Sidebar\n3. Update MainLayout for responsive handling\n4. Test responsive behavior on Manual Comparison page\n5. Validate type safety and build\n\nValidation includes both automated commands (type-check, lint, build) and manual testing steps with specific viewport sizes to verify the fixes work correctly.",
