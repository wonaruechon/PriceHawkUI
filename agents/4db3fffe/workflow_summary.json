  "prompt": "Implement Product Price Comparison Detail Page. Users can open this page by clicking on a product row from the overview page. Objective: Allow users to see full details of all matched products\u2014helping them verify if the compared products are truly identical or just similar. This enables manual checking when the system's automated match may be inaccurate. This detail page must include: Product name, Product description, Product images, SKU, Prices from each retailer, URL links to each retailer's product page. Display should anchor around Thai Watsadu's product, with other retailers shown as 'same item' or 'similar item' for verification. Design and layout should follow the concept similar to Reference [Image #2] (expected/image2.png) and [Image #3] (expected/image3.png). The UI should show: Left side - Thai Watsadu product info (name, description, image, SKU, price, URL), Right side - Matched products from other retailers with confidence rate, match type indicator (exact/similar), and their product details side by side for easy comparison.",
