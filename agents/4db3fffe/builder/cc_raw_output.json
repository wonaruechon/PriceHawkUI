Create Product Detail Page\n- Create `app/(main)/products/[id]/page.tsx`\n- Fetch product detail data using `GET /api/products/comparison/:id`\n- Layout: Two-column split view\n  - Left column (~40%): ProductDetailCard for Thai Watsadu product\n  - Right column (~60%): Grid/list of MatchedProductCard components\n- Add breadcrumb navigation: Products > Product Detail\n- Add back button to return to products list\n- Handle loading and error states\n- Make page responsive (stack on mobile)\n\n### 9. Update Products Page Navigation\n- Modify `handleRowClick` in `app/(main)/products/page.tsx`\n- Use Next.js router to navigate to `/products/[id]` when row is clicked\n- Import and use `useRouter` from `next/navigation`\n\n### 10. Validate Implementation\n- Run type checking with `npm run type-check`\n- Run linting with `npm run lint`\n- Run build with `npm run build`\n- Start dev server with `npm run dev`\n- Test navigation from products list to detail page\n- Verify all product information displays correctly\n- Test responsive layout on different screen sizes\n\n## Validation Commands\nExecute these commands to validate the chore is complete:\n\n```bash\n# Type checking - ensure no TypeScript errors\nnpm run type-check\n\n# Linting - ensure code style compliance\nnpm run lint\n\n# Build - ensure production build succeeds\nnpm run build\n\n# Start dev server and manually test\nnpm run dev\n# Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/products\n# Click on any product row to verify navigation to detail page\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n### UI Design Considerations\n- The design should clearly distinguish the \"anchor\" product (Thai Watsadu) from matched products\n- Confidence rate should be prominently displayed to help users assess match quality\n- Match type (exact/similar) should be immediately visible with color-coded badges\n- Product images should be displayed if available, with placeholder for missing images\n- External URLs should open in new tabs with proper `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"`\n\n### Data Considerations\n- The existing API endpoint already returns `matchedProducts` array with `confidence` and `matchType`\n- Mock data should include varied confidence rates and match types to demonstrate the UI\n- Consider adding \"similar\" matches with lower confidence (80-90%) to show the full range\n\n### Responsive Design\n- Desktop: Side-by-side two-column layout\n- Tablet: May reduce spacing but maintain two columns\n- Mobile: Stack vertically - Thai Watsadu product first, then matched products below\n\n### Accessibility\n- Ensure proper ARIA labels on interactive elements\n- External links should indicate they open in new window\n- Color-coded badges should also have text labels for color-blind users\n",
