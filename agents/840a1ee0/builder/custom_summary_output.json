  "output": "Now let me create a comprehensive summary:\n\n## Summary\n\nI have successfully implemented the manual comparison data persistence feature according to the specification. Here's what was completed:\n\n### Work Completed:\n\n1. **Created `lib/utils/manual-comparison-storage.ts`** - A comprehensive storage utility that:\n   - Saves manual comparison products to localStorage with unique IDs (format: `manual_<timestamp>_<sku>`)\n   - Transforms `ComparisonTableData` from the manual comparison API to `ProductComparison` format\n   - Calculates price status (cheapest/higher/same) based on comparison data\n   - Maps competitor retailer names to the standard `Retailer` enum\n   - Provides CRUD operations: save, get all, get by ID, update, delete, and clear all\n   - Includes helper function `isManualProductId()` to identify manual entries\n\n2. **Updated `app/(main)/comparison/page.tsx`** - Manual Comparison page now:\n   - Imports the new manual-comparison-storage utility\n   - Saves comparison results to localStorage after successful API response\n   - Updates success toast message to \"Comparison saved! View in Products page\"\n   - Adds a \"View in Products\" button that appears after saving\n   - Stores the saved product ID in state for navigation\n\n3. **Updated `app/(main)/products/page.tsx`** - Products listing page now:\n   - Fetches manual products from localStorage using `getAllManualComparisonProducts()`\n   - Merges manual products with API products (manual products appear first)\n   - Applies all filters (search, category, brand, status) to the merged dataset\n   - Applies sorting to the merged dataset\n   - Recalculates pagination based on filtered results\n   - Updates filter options (categories, brands) to include manual products\n   - Updates summary statistics to include manual product counts\n\n4. **Updated `app/api/products/comparison/[id]/route.ts`** - Product Detail API now:\n   - Detects manual product IDs (starts with `manual_`)\n   - Returns a special response indicating data should be loaded client-side\n   - Maintains backward compatibility for regular products\n\n5. **Updated `app/(main)/products/[id]/page.tsx`** - Product Detail page now:\n   - Imports manual-comparison-storage utilities\n   - Checks if the product ID is a manual entry\n   - Loads manual products directly from localStorage\n   - Transforms manual product data into `ProductComparisonDetailResponse` format\n   - Generates mock price history for manual products\n   - Creates matched products from manual product prices\n   - Marks matched products with `isManualEntry: true`\n   - Shows \"Manual Entry\" badge in page title for manual products\n\n6. **Updated `components/products/PriceComparisonRow.tsx`** - Table rows now:\n   - Imports `isManualProductId()` helper\n   - Checks if the product is a manual entry\n   - Displays a purple \"Manual\" badge next to the SKU for manual entries\n   - Maintains all existing functionality\n\n7. **Updated `components/products/PriceComparisonTable.tsx`** - Minor updates for compatibility\n\n### Files Changed:\n\n```\n app/(main)/comparison/page.tsx                 |  75 lines changed\n app/(main)/products/[id]/page.tsx              | 298 lines changed\n app/(main)/products/page.tsx                   | 139 lines changed\n app/api/products/comparison/[id]/route.ts      |  15 lines changed\n components/products/ManualComparisonButton.tsx |  13 lines changed\n components/products/PriceComparisonRow.tsx     |  15 lines changed\n components/products/PriceComparisonTable.tsx   |   5 lines changed\n \n New file: lib/utils/manual-comparison-storage.ts (300+ lines)\n \n Total: 533 lines added/modified across 7 files + 1 new file\n```\n\n### Validation:\n\n- \u2705 TypeScript compilation passes with no errors\n- \u2705 ESLint passes with no warnings or errors\n- \u2705 Production build successful\n- \u2705 All components properly typed\n- \u2705 Error handling implemented for localStorage operations\n- \u2705 Client-side rendering checks included\n\n### Key Features Implemented:\n\n- Manual comparison products persist across browser sessions\n- Manual products appear first in the Products list (most recent)\n- Visual indicators distinguish manual entries from regular products\n- Manual products work with all existing filters and sorting\n- Product detail page fully supports manual entries\n- Data structure maintains compatibility with existing `ProductComparison` type\n- Unique ID generation prevents conflicts with mock data\n- Graceful handling of localStorage unavailability"
