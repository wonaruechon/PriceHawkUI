Add Data Management Functions\n- In manual-comparison-storage.ts:\n  - Add `clearAllManualProducts()` - For testing/reset\n  - Add `updateManualProduct(id: string, updates: Partial<ProductComparison>)` - For future edits\n  - Add export function to export manual products to CSV/JSON\n\n### 9. Test Data Flow End-to-End\n- Start dev server (`npm run dev`)\n- Navigate to Manual Comparison page (`/comparison`)\n- Complete a manual comparison with Thai Watsadu SKU and competitor URLs\n- Verify success message shows \"saved\"\n- Navigate to Products page (`/products`)\n- Verify manual product appears in table with all details\n- Verify manual entry badge is visible\n- Click on manual product row\n- Navigate to Product Detail page\n- Verify all comparison data displays correctly\n- Refresh browser\n- Verify manual product persists across page reloads\n\n### 10. Handle Edge Cases and Validation\n- Test with duplicate SKUs (manual vs mock data) - Should merge or show both\n- Test with invalid/missing data fields\n- Test localStorage quota limits (handle gracefully)\n- Test with empty comparison results\n- Add error handling for JSON parse failures\n- Add TypeScript strict type checking\n\n## Validation Commands\n\nExecute these commands to validate the chore is complete:\n\n```bash\n# Type check - ensure no TypeScript errors\nnpm run type-check\n\n# Lint - ensure code quality\nnpm run lint\n\n# Build - ensure production build works\nnpm run build\n\n# Run dev server for manual testing\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Manual Testing Steps\n\n1. **Create Manual Comparison**:\n   ```\n   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/comparison\n   - Enter Thai Watsadu SKU: \"TEST123\"\n   - Enter Thai Watsadu URL\n   - Add at least 2 competitors with URLs\n   - Click through to Results stage\n   - Verify success message includes \"saved\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Products Page**:\n   ```\n   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/products\n   - Search for \"TEST123\" or scroll to find manual entry\n   - Verify product appears with:\n     - Correct SKU, name, brand, category\n     - Prices from Thai Watsadu and competitors\n     - Status badge (cheapest/higher/same)\n     - \"Manual Entry\" badge or indicator\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Product Detail Page**:\n   ```\n   - Click on the manual product in the table\n   - Verify URL contains manual product ID (starts with \"manual_\")\n   - Verify all product details display correctly\n   - Verify competitor prices appear in matched products section\n   ```\n\n4. **Test Persistence**:\n   ```\n   - Refresh the browser\n   - Navigate back to /products\n   - Verify manual product still appears\n   - Open browser DevTools > Application > Local Storage\n   - Verify key exists: pricehawk_manual_products\n   - Verify data structure is valid JSON\n   ```\n\n5. **Test Filtering and Sorting**:\n   ```\n   - On Products page, apply filters (brand, category, status)\n   - Verify manual products filter correctly\n   - Sort by different columns\n   - Verify manual products sort correctly alongside mock data\n   ```\n\n## Notes\n\n- **Storage Limitations**: localStorage has a 5-10MB limit. Consider implementing storage quota warnings if approaching limits. For production, this should be replaced with a backend database.\n\n- **Data Format Compatibility**: The `ComparisonTableData` format from manual comparison API must be carefully transformed to match the `ProductComparison` format expected by the Products page. Pay special attention to:\n  - Retailer name format differences (`THAI_WATSADU` vs `thai_watsadu`)\n  - Price object structure (`prices[retailer]` object with `price`, `productUrl`, etc.)\n  - Status calculation logic (needs to match existing price-utils.ts logic)\n\n- **ID Generation**: Manual product IDs should use a consistent format like `manual_${timestamp}_${sku}` to:\n  - Avoid conflicts with mock data IDs\n  - Be easily identifiable as manual entries\n  - Maintain uniqueness across multiple manual comparisons of the same SKU\n\n- **Merge Strategy**: When merging manual products with mock data:\n  - Manual products should appear first (for visibility)\n  - OR group manual products separately with a divider\n  - OR allow filtering to show only manual/only mock products\n\n- **Future Enhancements**:\n  - Add edit/delete functionality for manual products\n  - Add import/export for manual comparison data\n  - Add validation to prevent duplicate manual entries\n  - Sync with backend API when available\n  - Add manual entry history/audit log\n\n- **Type Safety**: Ensure all transform functions maintain type safety. Use TypeScript's type guards and assertions where needed.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle scenarios like:\n  - localStorage unavailable (private browsing)\n  - Corrupted data in localStorage\n  - Missing required fields in comparison data\n  - API errors when fetching initial product list\n","numLines":255,"startLine":1,"totalLines":255}}}
