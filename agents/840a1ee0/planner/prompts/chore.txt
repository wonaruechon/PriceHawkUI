/chore 840a1ee0 When a product is added through the Manual Comparison page, save the manually compared 
  product data so it displays on the Products page (app/(main)/products/page.tsx) in the price comparison table and also on 
  the Product Comparison Detail page (app/(main)/products/[id]/page.tsx). The manually added product should show the same 
  information as other products including SKU, product name, brand, category, status, and prices from different retailers. 
  Ensure the manual comparison results are persisted and integrated with the existing product display logic.
