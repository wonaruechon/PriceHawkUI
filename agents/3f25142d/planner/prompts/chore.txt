/chore 3f25142d Fix PriceHawk UI layout to match design: 1)
  Add 'No.' column as first column in PriceComparisonTable showing row numbers (1,
   2, 3, etc.) 2) Update ProductSearchFilter layout to put Reset and Export
  buttons on the same row as the search input and dropdown selects - all elements
  should be in a single horizontal flex row with proper spacing 3) Wrap the Price
  Comparison table section in a white card container with shadow and rounded
  corners (bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6) similar to the Search & Filter card
