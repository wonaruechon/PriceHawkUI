  "output": "Perfect! Now let me provide a final summary:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the **Manual Comparison Button** feature for products where all matched competitor products are marked as 'incorrect'. Here's what was completed:\n\n### Work Completed:\n\n1. **Created helper function** `areAllCompetitorMatchesIncorrect()` in `PriceComparisonRow.tsx` (components/products/PriceComparisonRow.tsx:44-65)\n   - Checks if all competitor retailers (HOMEPRO, GLOBAL_HOUSE, DOHOME, BOONTHAVORN) have validation status 'incorrect'\n   - Excludes THAI_WATSADU as it's the reference retailer\n   - Properly handles edge cases (undefined statuses, missing entries)\n\n2. **Created ManualComparisonButton component** (components/products/ManualComparisonButton.tsx)\n   - Client-side button using Next.js router navigation\n   - Navigates to `/comparison?sku={sku}&productId={productId}`\n   - Styled consistently with ExportButton (cyan theme, Tailwind CSS)\n   - Uses Search icon from Lucide for visual consistency\n   - Prevents row click event propagation\n\n3. **Integrated button into PriceComparisonRow** (components/products/PriceComparisonRow.tsx:112-171)\n   - Conditionally renders Manual Comparison Button when all competitors are incorrect\n   - Button spans all 4 competitor columns (colSpan={4}) for clean layout\n   - Keeps all product info cells visible (NO., SKU, NAME, BRAND, CATEGORY, STATUS, THAI WATSADU)\n   - Only replaces competitor price cells with the button\n\n4. **Updated Comparison page to handle query parameters** (app/(main)/comparison/page.tsx:96-112)\n   - Added useSearchParams to read `sku` and `productId` from URL\n   - Pre-fills the Thai Watsadu SKU field automatically\n   - Wrapped component in Suspense boundary to handle SSR/SSG properly\n   - Added loading fallback for better UX\n\n5. **TypeScript types** - All properly typed, no new types needed\n\n6. **Validation** - Type check and build both pass successfully\n\n### Files Changed:\n```\napp/(main)/comparison/page.tsx             | 43 lines (+41, -2)\ncomponents/products/PriceComparisonRow.tsx | 174 lines (new logic + restructuring)\ncomponents/products/ManualComparisonButton.tsx | 32 lines (new file)\n```\n\n**Total: 3 files, 247 lines changed**\n\n### Key Features:\n- \u2705 Automatically detects when ALL competitor matches are marked incorrect\n- \u2705 Shows prominent \"Manual Comparison\" button centered in the row\n- \u2705 Navigates to comparison page with pre-filled SKU\n- \u2705 Clean UI with proper column spanning\n- \u2705 Handles Next.js SSR/SSG requirements with Suspense\n- \u2705 Type-safe implementation\n- \u2705 Build passes successfully\n\nThe implementation is complete and ready for testing! Users can now easily trigger manual comparison when automatic matching fails for all competitors."
