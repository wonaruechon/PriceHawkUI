  "output": "Perfect! I've created the plan document for fixing the Status Badge visibility issue.\n\n## Plan Created\n\nThe plan has been saved to: **`specs/chore-af1b005f-fix-status-badge-visibility.md`**\n\n### Summary\n\nThis chore fixes a Tailwind CSS configuration issue where Status Badge background colors are not visible. The problem is that:\n\n1. The `getStatusColor` function in `lib/utils/price-utils.ts` correctly uses hardcoded Tailwind classes (`bg-green-500`, `bg-amber-500`, `bg-gray-500`)\n2. However, `tailwind.config.js` only scans `pages/`, `components/`, and `app/` directories\n3. The `lib/` directory is not being scanned, so Tailwind's JIT compiler doesn't include these classes\n\n**The fix:** Add `'./lib/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'` to the content array in `tailwind.config.js`\n\nThe plan includes:\n- Detailed explanation of the issue\n- Step-by-step tasks to update the configuration\n- Validation commands to verify the fix works\n- Testing instructions to confirm Status Badge colors are visible",
