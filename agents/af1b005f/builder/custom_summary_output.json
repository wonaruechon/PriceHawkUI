  "output": "## Report\n\nSuccessfully implemented the Status Badge visibility fix. Here's what was completed:\n\n### Work Summary\n\n- **Updated Tailwind Configuration**: Added `'./lib/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'` to the content array in `tailwind.config.js` (line 7) to enable Tailwind's JIT compiler to scan the lib directory\n- **Removed Custom Color Theme**: Cleaned up the theme.extend section by removing the custom status color definitions that are no longer needed since we're using hardcoded Tailwind classes\n- **Validated Configuration**: Confirmed valid JavaScript syntax with proper array formatting and comma separation\n- **Ran All Validation Commands**:\n  - \u2713 Cleared Next.js cache (.next directory)\n  - \u2713 Type checking passed (tsc --noEmit)\n  - \u2713 Linting passed (no ESLint warnings or errors)\n  - \u2713 Production build succeeded (compiled successfully in 1969ms)\n\n### Files Changed\n\nThe changes to the PriceHack project specifically:\n\n```\n PriceHack/lib/utils/price-utils.ts |  8 ++++----\n PriceHack/tailwind.config.js       | 10 ++--------\n 2 files changed, 6 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-)\n```\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe fix resolves the issue where Status Badge colors weren't appearing because:\n- The `getStatusColor` function in `lib/utils/price-utils.ts:129-142` uses hardcoded Tailwind classes (`bg-green-500`, `bg-amber-500`, etc.)\n- Tailwind's JIT compiler only scanned directories in the content array (pages, components, app)\n- By adding the lib directory to the content array, Tailwind now detects and includes these utility classes in the generated CSS\n\nThe application is now ready for deployment with working Status Badge colors for all price comparison states (cheapest/green, higher/amber, same/gray, unavailable/light gray)."
