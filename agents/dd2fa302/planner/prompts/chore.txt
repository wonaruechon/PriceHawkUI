/chore dd2fa302 Fix the Status Badge visibility issue in the
   Product Price Comparison page. The badges (Cheapest/Higher/Same) exist in the
  DOM but have transparent backgrounds because Tailwind's JIT compiler cannot
  detect the dynamically generated class names (bg-status-cheapest,
  bg-status-higher, bg-status-same). Fix by either: 1) Adding a safelist to
  tailwind.config.js for these classes, OR 2) Modifying StatusBadge.tsx to use
  hardcoded Tailwind classes instead of dynamic ones from getStatusColor(). The
  expected colors are: Cheapest=#10B981 (green), Higher=#F59E0B (yellow/orange),
  Same=#6B7280 (gray), Unavailable=#D1D5DB (light gray).
