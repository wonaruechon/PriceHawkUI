    "Fix the Status Badge visibility issue in the\n   Product Price Comparison page. The badges (Cheapest/Higher/Same) exist in the\n  DOM but have transparent backgrounds because Tailwind's JIT compiler cannot\n  detect the dynamically generated class names (bg-status-cheapest,\n  bg-status-higher, bg-status-same). Fix by either: 1) Adding a safelist to\n  tailwind.config.js for these classes, OR 2) Modifying StatusBadge.tsx to use\n  hardcoded Tailwind classes instead of dynamic ones from getStatusColor(). The\n  expected colors are: Cheapest=#10B981 (green), Higher=#F59E0B (yellow/orange),\n  Same=#6B7280 (gray), Unavailable=#D1D5DB (light gray)."

I've created the plan document for fixing the Status Badge visibility issue.\n\n## Summary\n\nPlan created at: **`specs/chore-dd2fa302-fix-status-badge-visibility.md`**\n\n**The Issue:**\nStatus badges exist in the DOM but have transparent backgrounds because Tailwind's JIT compiler cannot detect dynamically generated class names like `bg-status-cheapest` that are returned from the `getStatusColor()` function.\n\n**The Solution:**\nReplace dynamic custom color classes with hardcoded Tailwind utility classes:\n- Cheapest: `bg-green-500 text-white`\n- Higher: `bg-amber-500 text-white`  \n- Same: `bg-gray-500 text-white`\n- N/A: `bg-gray-300 text-gray-600`\n\nThis approach is superior to using a safelist because it's more maintainable, follows Tailwind best practices, and ensures the JIT compiler can detect and include the necessary CSS at build time.\n\nThe plan includes 5 steps with validation commands to ensure the fix works correctly.",
