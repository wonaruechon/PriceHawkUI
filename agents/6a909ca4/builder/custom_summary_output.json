  "output": "Perfect! The implementation is complete. The changes show that the PriceComparisonRow.tsx file now:\n1. Does NOT import ManualComparisonButton\n2. Does NOT have the `areAllCompetitorMatchesIncorrect()` function\n3. Does NOT have the `showManualComparisonButton` variable\n4. Always displays competitor price cells without conditional rendering of the Manual Comparison button\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the chore to remove the Manual Comparison button from the Products page:\n\n### Work Completed:\n- Removed the `ManualComparisonButton` import from `PriceComparisonRow.tsx`\n- Removed the `areAllCompetitorMatchesIncorrect()` helper function that checked if all competitor matches were marked incorrect\n- Removed the `showManualComparisonButton` variable\n- Removed the conditional rendering logic that would display the Manual Comparison button instead of competitor price cells\n- Competitor price cells are now always displayed, regardless of validation status\n- The `isRetailerPriceHidden()` function remains intact to continue hiding individual retailer prices when marked as incorrect\n\n### Files and Lines Changed:\n```\ngit diff HEAD --stat\n```\nTotal changes across all staged files:\n- 9 files changed\n- 776 insertions(+), 15 deletions(-)\n\nSpecific to this chore (PriceComparisonRow.tsx):\n- **components/products/PriceComparisonRow.tsx**: 134 lines (new file in staging)\n- The file now has a cleaner structure with no Manual Comparison button logic\n\n### Validation:\n- TypeScript type checking passed with no errors\n- All Manual Comparison button references successfully removed from PriceComparisonRow\n- Competitor prices are now always displayed on the Products page"
