/chore 18cd112b Adjust UI design for Manual Comparison page with the following changes:

  1. LOGO UPDATES - Update retailer logos in both Input stage (CompetitorInputCard) and Results stage to use PNG logos from 
  'expected/logo/' folder:
     - HomePro: /expected/logo/homepro.png
     - MegaHome: /expected/logo/megahome.png
     - Boonthavorn: /expected/logo/boonthavorn.png
     - Global House: /expected/logo/globalhouse.png
     - DoHome: /expected/logo/dohome.png
     - Thai Watsadu: /expected/logo/thaiwatsau.png
     Update the logo paths in lib/constants/competitors.ts and ensure logos display correctly in retailer selection grid and 
  results display.

  2. RESULTS PAGE CLEANUP - In the comparison results view:
     - Remove price difference display (e.g., '฿325 more expensive (+7.5%)' badge/text)
     - Remove pricing details section: discount percentage, unit price fields
     - Remove stock status/availability info but KEEP the product URL link
     - Ensure consistent font sizing across all elements on the page

  3. PAGE HEADER - Remove the subtitle text 'Compare products across retailers with Apple-style elegance' from the Manual 
  Comparison page header in app/(main)/comparison/page.tsx

  Files to modify: lib/constants/competitors.ts, components/comparison/CompetitorInputCard.tsx, 
  app/(main)/comparison/page.tsx, and any result display components showing price comparisons.
