  "prompt": "Enhance Manual Comparison page UX/UI inspired by Apple iPhone Compare page \n  (https://www.apple.com/th/iphone/compare/) while PRESERVING exact input requirements. KEEP EXISTING INPUT FLOW: 1) THAI \n  WATSADU (Main Input) - SKU field (required), Product URL from Thai Watsadu (required). 2) COMPETITOR INPUTS - Retailer Name\n   dropdown (select ONLY from: HomePro, MegaHome, Boonthavorn, Global House, DoHome), Product URL for each retailer \n  (required). Users can add MULTIPLE competitor entries but each must belong to approved retailer list only. ENHANCE WITH \n  APPLE-STYLE DESIGN: INPUT SECTION - Clean card-based layout for ThaiWatsadu input card and competitor input cards, '+Add \n  Competitor' button to add more retailer entries, each competitor card shows retailer dropdown + URL input with remove \n  button, form validation with clear error states. COMPARISON RESULT VIEW (after submission): 1) STICKY HEADER - ThaiWatsadu \n  product in first column, competitor products in subsequent columns, product images and retailer logos fixed at top while \n  scrolling. 2) SIDE-BY-SIDE COLUMN LAYOUT - first column for attribute labels, remaining columns for ThaiWatsadu vs each \n  competitor (HomePro, MegaHome, etc.). 3) GROUPED SPEC SECTIONS - Pricing section (price, discount %, unit price, price \n  difference), Product Info section (name, SKU, brand, category), Availability section (stock status). 4) PRICE COMPARISON \n  HIGHLIGHT - large bold typography for prices like Apple's screen size display (e.g., '\u0e3f1,299' in large text), color-coded \n  difference (green=ThaiWatsadu cheaper, red=competitor cheaper, show \u0e3f amount and % difference). 5) VISUAL INDICATORS - \n  checkmarks for matching attributes, warning icons for significant price differences, dashes for unavailable data. 6) \n  RETAILER BRANDING - show retailer logo/name in each column header. 7) CTA per column - 'View Product' link to original URL \n  for each retailer. 8) CLEAN WHITESPACE with subtle dividers between spec groups. 9) RESPONSIVE TABLE with proper semantic \n  HTML. Keep multi-step flow: Step 1 (Input ThaiWatsadu + Competitors) -> Step 2 (Review/Confirm) -> Step 3 (Comparison \n  Results in Apple-style table).",
