/chore ea4d1e03 Modify Product Comparison Detail page to show a 'Manual Comparison' button instead of 
  inline ManualComparisonForm when all matched products are marked as incorrect.

  CURRENT BEHAVIOR (in app/(main)/products/[id]/page.tsx):
  - When shouldShowManualForm is true (all products marked incorrect), it renders an inline <ManualComparisonForm /> 
  component directly on the detail page
  - The logic uses areAllProductsIncorrect() function to determine this state

  DESIRED BEHAVIOR:
  - When all matched products are marked as 'incorrect', instead of showing the inline ManualComparisonForm, display a 
  'Manual Comparison' button
  - The button should navigate to /comparison page with query params to pre-fill the form:
    - sku={data.product.sku}
    - productId={productId}
    - name={data.product.name} (URL encoded)
    - Optional: price, imageUrl from Thai Watsadu data

  CHANGES REQUIRED:
  1. In the section where shouldShowManualForm is true (lines 439-451), replace the inline ManualComparisonForm with:
     - Keep the yellow warning box that says 'All matched products have been marked as incorrect'
     - Replace ManualComparisonForm with a styled 'Manual Comparison' button
     - Button should use Next.js Link or router.push to navigate to /comparison page with query params

  2. Button styling should:
     - Be prominent and clearly visible (primary color like blue-600)
     - Include an icon (e.g., external link or compare icon from lucide-react)
     - Match existing button styles in the codebase (Tailwind CSS)

  3. Optionally update /comparison page (app/(main)/comparison/page.tsx) to:
     - Read query params on mount
     - Pre-fill the Thai Watsadu SKU/URL input fields with the passed data

  KEEP:
  - All existing validation logic (areAllProductsIncorrect, validationStatuses, etc.)
  - The ManualComparisonData display section (lines 454-470)
  - Reset functionality
  - Can remove or keep the ManualComparisonForm import depending on if it's used elsewhere
