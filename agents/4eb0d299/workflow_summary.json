Test steps: 1) Navigate to the comparison page, 2) Take a screenshot of the initial state\n   showing the retailer grid (HomePro, MegaHome, Boonthavorn, Global House, DoHome buttons visible), 3) Click on the HomePro\n  retailer button, 4) Take a screenshot after clicking - verify: the retailer grid is hidden, HomePro is shown as selected\n  with blue brand color and logo, the Product URL input is enabled with placeholder 'https://www.homepro.co.th/...', and a\n  'Change' button appears, 5) Click the 'Change' button to verify the retailer grid reappears, 6) Select MegaHome retailer\n  and verify it shows with green brand color. Save screenshots to .playwright-mcp/ folder with descriptive names like\n  'retailer-selection-before.png' and 'retailer-selection-after.png'. Report PASS if all validations succeed, FAIL with\n  details if any step fails.",
