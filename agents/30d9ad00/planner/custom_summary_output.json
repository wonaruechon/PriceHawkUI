    "Implement Product Price Comparison Detail \n  Page. Users can open this page by clicking on a product row from the overview \n  page. Objective: Allow users to see full details of all matched products\u2014helping\n   them verify if the compared products are truly identical or just similar. This \n  enables manual checking when the system's automated match may be inaccurate. \n  This detail page must include: Product name, Product description, Product \n  images, SKU, Prices from each retailer, URL links to each retailer's product \n  page. Display should anchor around Thai Watsadu's product, with other retailers \n  shown as 'same item' or 'similar item' for verification. Design and layout \n  should follow the concept similar to Reference [Image #2] (expected/image2.png) \n  and [Image #3] (expected/image3.png). The UI should show: Left side - Thai \n  Watsadu product info (name, description, image, SKU, price, URL), Right side - \n  Matched products from other retailers with confidence rate, match type indicator\n   (exact/similar), and their product details side by side for easy comparison."

  "output": "Perfect! I've created a comprehensive plan for implementing the Product Price Comparison Detail Page. Here's a summary:\n\n## Plan Created: `specs/chore-30d9ad00-product-price-comparison-detail-page.md`\n\n### Overview\nThe plan provides a complete roadmap for implementing a product detail page that allows users to verify price matches across retailers. The page will display Thai Watsadu's product as the reference on the left, with matched products from other retailers on the right, including confidence rates and match type indicators.\n\n### Key Findings from Codebase Research\n1. **Components Already Exist**: I discovered that the supporting components (`ProductDetailCard`, `MatchedProductCard`, `ConfidenceBadge`, `MatchTypeBadge`) are already created\n2. **API Endpoint Ready**: The detail API endpoint (`/api/products/comparison/[id]/route.ts`) already returns matched products with confidence and match types\n3. **Navigation Implemented**: The products overview page already handles row clicks and navigates to the detail page\n4. **Main Task**: Only need to create the detail page component (`app/(main)/products/[id]/page.tsx`) that ties everything together\n\n### Plan Structure\nThe plan includes:\n- **10 Step-by-step tasks** covering verification, implementation, and validation\n- **Detailed component requirements** for the two-column layout\n- **Responsive design guidelines** for desktop, tablet, and mobile\n- **Validation commands** for type checking, linting, and building\n- **Reference to UI mockups** in `expected/image2.png` and `expected/image3.png`\n\nThe plan is ready for implementation using the `/implement` command.",
