/chore 30d9ad00 Implement Product Price Comparison Detail 
  Page. Users can open this page by clicking on a product row from the overview 
  page. Objective: Allow users to see full details of all matched products—helping
   them verify if the compared products are truly identical or just similar. This 
  enables manual checking when the system's automated match may be inaccurate. 
  This detail page must include: Product name, Product description, Product 
  images, SKU, Prices from each retailer, URL links to each retailer's product 
  page. Display should anchor around Thai Watsadu's product, with other retailers 
  shown as 'same item' or 'similar item' for verification. Design and layout 
  should follow the concept similar to Reference [Image #2] (expected/image2.png) 
  and [Image #3] (expected/image3.png). The UI should show: Left side - Thai 
  Watsadu product info (name, description, image, SKU, price, URL), Right side - 
  Matched products from other retailers with confidence rate, match type indicator
   (exact/similar), and their product details side by side for easy comparison.
