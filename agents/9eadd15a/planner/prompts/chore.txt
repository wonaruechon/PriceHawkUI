/chore 9eadd15a Adjust the Products page price comparison table UI with the following changes:

  1. COLUMN ORDERING - Reorder table columns to: NO., SKU, PRODUCT NAME, BRAND, CATEGORY, STATUS, then all retailer price
  columns (THAI WATSADU, HOMEPRO, GLOBAL HOUSE, DO HOME, BOONTHAVORN). Move STATUS column to be before the price columns for
  better visual flow.

  2. PRICE COLOR CODING - Apply dynamic color styling to each individual price cell based on comparison logic:
     - GREEN (#10B981 or text-green-600): The cell with the LOWEST/CHEAPEST price among all retailers for that product row
     - GRAY (#6B7280 or text-gray-500): Prices that are the SAME or within 1-2% of the cheapest price (similar/matching
  prices)
     - RED (#EF4444 or text-red-600): Prices that are HIGHER than the cheapest price (not matching the minimum)

  3. Each price cell should be individually colored based on whether that specific retailer's price is the cheapest, same, or
   higher compared to other retailers in the same row. Remove the current uniform teal color.

  4. Keep the external link icons on prices but apply the dynamic color to both the price text and icon.

  5. The STATUS badge column should remain as-is (Cheapest=green, Same=gray, Higher=yellow/orange badges) but reflect the
  overall product status.
