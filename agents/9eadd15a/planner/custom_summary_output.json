    "Adjust the Products page price comparison table UI with the following changes:\n\n  1. COLUMN ORDERING - Reorder table columns to: NO., SKU, PRODUCT NAME, BRAND, CATEGORY, STATUS, then all retailer price\n  columns (THAI WATSADU, HOMEPRO, GLOBAL HOUSE, DO HOME, BOONTHAVORN). Move STATUS column to be before the price columns for\n  better visual flow.\n\n  2. PRICE COLOR CODING - Apply dynamic color styling to each individual price cell based on comparison logic:\n     - GREEN (#10B981 or text-green-600): The cell with the LOWEST/CHEAPEST price among all retailers for that product row\n     - GRAY (#6B7280 or text-gray-500): Prices that are the SAME or within 1-2% of the cheapest price (similar/matching\n  prices)\n     - RED (#EF4444 or text-red-600): Prices that are HIGHER than the cheapest price (not matching the minimum)\n\n  3. Each price cell should be individually colored based on whether that specific retailer's price is the cheapest, same, or\n   higher compared to other retailers in the same row. Remove the current uniform teal color.\n\n  4. Keep the external link icons on prices but apply the dynamic color to both the price text and icon.\n\n  5. The STATUS badge column should remain as-is (Cheapest=green, Same=gray, Higher=yellow/orange badges) but reflect the\n  overall product status."

  "output": "Perfect! I've created a comprehensive plan for the chore. The plan document has been saved to:\n\n**`specs/chore-9eadd15a-adjust-price-table-ui.md`**\n\nThe plan includes:\n\n1. **Detailed research-based approach** - I analyzed the existing codebase structure including:\n   - PriceComparisonTable.tsx (header columns)\n   - PriceComparisonRow.tsx (data columns)\n   - PriceCell.tsx (individual price display with current teal color)\n   - price-utils.ts (existing price calculation logic)\n\n2. **5 clear implementation steps**:\n   - Add a price comparison helper function to centralize the color logic\n   - Update PriceCell component to use the new three-state color system\n   - Reorder columns and add comparison logic in PriceComparisonRow\n   - Update table headers in PriceComparisonTable\n   - Test and validate all changes\n\n3. **Specific validation commands** including type-check, lint, build, and manual testing steps\n\n4. **Important notes** about maintaining the STATUS badge functionality, threshold consistency, and accessibility considerations\n\nThe plan is ready for execution and addresses all requirements from the chore prompt.",
