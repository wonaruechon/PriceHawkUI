  "prompt": "Adjust the Products page price comparison table UI with the following changes:\n\n  1. COLUMN ORDERING - Reorder table columns to: NO., SKU, PRODUCT NAME, BRAND, CATEGORY, STATUS, then all retailer price\n  columns (THAI WATSADU, HOMEPRO, GLOBAL HOUSE, DO HOME, BOONTHAVORN). Move STATUS column to be before the price columns for\n  better visual flow.\n\n  2. PRICE COLOR CODING - Apply dynamic color styling to each individual price cell based on comparison logic:\n     - GREEN (#10B981 or text-green-600): The cell with the LOWEST/CHEAPEST price among all retailers for that product row\n     - GRAY (#6B7280 or text-gray-500): Prices that are the SAME or within 1-2% of the cheapest price (similar/matching\n  prices)\n     - RED (#EF4444 or text-red-600): Prices that are HIGHER than the cheapest price (not matching the minimum)\n\n  3. Each price cell should be individually colored based on whether that specific retailer's price is the cheapest, same, or\n   higher compared to other retailers in the same row. Remove the current uniform teal color.\n\n  4. Keep the external link icons on prices but apply the dynamic color to both the price text and icon.\n\n  5. The STATUS badge column should remain as-is (Cheapest=green, Same=gray, Higher=yellow/orange badges) but reflect the\n  overall product status.",
