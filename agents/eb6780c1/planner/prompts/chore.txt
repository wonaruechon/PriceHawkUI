/chore eb6780c1 Update the Products list page (app/(main)/products/page.tsx) and PriceComparisonTable
  component to respect validation statuses stored in localStorage. When a matched product is marked as 'incorrect' on the
  Product Comparison Detail page, the corresponding retailer price should be hidden (show '-' or empty) on the Products list
  page table. The validation statuses are stored in localStorage with key pattern 'pricehawk_validation_{productId}' and
  contain a statuses object mapping '{retailer}_{sku}' to ValidationStatus. Add a utility function 
  getAllValidationStatusesForAllProducts() in lib/utils/validation-storage.ts to retrieve all validation statuses across 
  products. In PriceComparisonRow component, check if the retailer price has been marked 'incorrect' and hide it accordingly.
   The PriceCell component should accept an optional 'hidden' prop to display '-' instead of the price when the matched 
  product was marked incorrect.
