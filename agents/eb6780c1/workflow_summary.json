  "prompt": "Update the Products list page (app/(main)/products/page.tsx) and PriceComparisonTable\n  component to respect validation statuses stored in localStorage. When a matched product is marked as 'incorrect' on the\n  Product Comparison Detail page, the corresponding retailer price should be hidden (show '-' or empty) on the Products list\n  page table. The validation statuses are stored in localStorage with key pattern 'pricehawk_validation_{productId}' and\n  contain a statuses object mapping '{retailer}_{sku}' to ValidationStatus. Add a utility function \n  getAllValidationStatusesForAllProducts() in lib/utils/validation-storage.ts to retrieve all validation statuses across \n  products. In PriceComparisonRow component, check if the retailer price has been marked 'incorrect' and hide it accordingly.\n   The PriceCell component should accept an optional 'hidden' prop to display '-' instead of the price when the matched \n  product was marked incorrect.",
